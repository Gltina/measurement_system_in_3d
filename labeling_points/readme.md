# Labeling points to be detected

The purpose of this stage is to select a bunch of points that could represent the shape to be detected while fitting and showing it on screen in real-time for checking.

## Requirements

- OpenSceneGraph(OSG) 3.6.4

- The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library(CGAL) 5.0.2

## Progress

- [x] fitting line & showing
- [x] fitting plane & showing
- [x] fitting cylinder & showing // TODO
- [ ] export to file (To decide which format to store selection information)
- [ ] communication with other components successfully

## Demo in each stage
