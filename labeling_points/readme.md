# Labeling points to be detected

The purpose of this stage is to select a bunch of points that could represent the shape to be detected while fitting and showing it on screen in real-time for checking.

## Requirements

- OpenSceneGraph(OSG) 3.6.4

- The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library(CGAL) 5.0.2

## Progress & Record

- [x] Fitting line & showing
- [x] Fitting plane & showing
- [x] Fitting cylinder & showing // TODO
- [x] Supported export to file

## Usage

``` shell
xxx.exe  <point_cloud> <output_folder>
```
